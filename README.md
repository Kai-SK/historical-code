  ## 👋 Hi there, I'm Kai!

I'm a data analyst/data scientist with 8+ years of experience helping businesses transform complex data into clear, actionable insights — particularly in client-facing and B2B environments across Asia. Today, I bring a unique mix of deep business context, technical sharpness, and a passion for data to solve real-world problems through storytelling, automation, and smart systems.

📚 I studied data science at the National University of Singapore (NUS) and work across the full data stack — from SQL and Python-powered analytics pipelines to machine learning models and polished dashboards (Power BI, Tableau).

🌍 Most recently, I’ve led data-driven initiatives across Southeast Asia at Jotun, optimized town council operations in Singapore, and built an AI-powered travel itinerary agent for fun. No matter what problem I'm working on, I’m always up for building practical, elegant solutions. I also enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams — whether it's engineers, marketers, or top management.
